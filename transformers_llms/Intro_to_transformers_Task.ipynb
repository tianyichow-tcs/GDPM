Batching allows the network to perform computations on multiple examples simultaneously, which speeds up training and inference. However, for batching to work, all examples in a batch must have the same shape (i.e., the same number of tokens).\n",
        "\n",
        "Since text sequences have variable lengths, we use padding to make them uniform. Padding involves adding special padding tokens to shorter sequences to make them the same length as the longest sequence in the batch. This ensures that all examples in a batch have a consistent shape, enabling efficient batch processing."

This allows the model to effectively translate, summarize, or otherwise transform the input based on the learned relationships between the two sequences. In the following code, we implement a `CrossAttention` class. The main difference with self-attention is that the keys and values will be sourced from a different source than the query."

In this section, we'll be tackling a more complex task: **sequence generation**. This requires us to introduce the **Decoder** component of the Transformer architecture.\n",

        "The Decoder's role is to take the encoded representation of the input sequence (generated by the Encoder) and generate an output sequence, one token at a time. While its architecture shares many similarities with the Encoder, there are some crucial distinctions that enable it to perform this generative task:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences Between the Decoder and Encoder:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Cross-Attention:**  Perhaps the most significant difference is the inclusion of **cross-attention** layers. In each decoder layer, cross-attention allows the decoder to attend to the *encoder's* output. This enables the decoder to incorporate information from the input sequence when generating the output. The decoder's embeddings are used as queries, while the encoder's embeddings are used as keys and values.\n",
        "2.  **Shifted Right Input:** During training, the decoder's input is the target sequence, *shifted one position to the right* and prepended with a special \"start\" token. This is done to facilitate **teacher forcing**, where the model is trained to predict the next token given the *previous* ground-truth tokens. The reason is that, at inference time, the model will generate the sequence auto-regressively, therefore it is useful to train it with a similar distribution of inputs.\n",
        "3.  **Causal Masking:** To prevent the decoder from \"cheating\" during training and peeking at future tokens, a **causal mask** (also known as a look-ahead mask) is applied during self-attention within the decoder. This mask ensures that the model can only attend to tokens that have already been generated, effectively simulating the auto-regressive nature of sequence generation during inference.\n",

        "**Detailed Exploration in the Following Cells:**\n",

        "We'll delve into each of these key features – cross-attention, shifted right input, and causal masking – in more detail in the following cells. We'll examine their implementation and understand their crucial role in enabling the decoder to effectively generate sequences. By understanding these components, we'll gain a deeper appreciation for the Transformer's ability to tackle complex sequence-to-sequence tasks."

        "To achieve this, we **pass the encoder's output as an input to the decoder**. This encoded representation serves as the decoder's \"memory\" of the input sequence.  By using cross-attention layers, the decoder can then selectively attend to different parts of this encoded input while generating each token of the output sequence. This allows the decoder to make informed decisions based on the entire context of the input, leading to more accurate and coherent output generation. The `targets` will be used by the decoder to guide its generation process, computing a loss with the prediction at each step."

        "This masking is essential because, during inference, the model generates the sequence one token at a time. It doesn't have access to future tokens, so it must rely only on its past predictions and the encoded input. By enforcing this constraint during training with causal masking, we ensure that the model learns to generate sequences in a truly autoregressive manner, making it suitable for realistic inference scenarios where future information is unavailable. The following class `MaskedSelfAttention` implements this masking mechanism."

In our previous implementation, we used randomly initialized, learnable positional embeddings.\n",
